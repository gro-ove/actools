Now, CM got a feature allowing to quickly create new skins. It’s still WIP, more types of customization might be added later.

By default, CM tries to detect editable textures automatically by textures names and shaders used, and, for [url="https://github.com/MadMat13/CM-Paint-Shop/"]some cars[/url], it would use a remote storage providing rules to skin them. But, if you want, either for car you’re working on or for any other car, you can specify custom rules using a wide range of options.
